# [WIP] CSOWP SR - Constant Swarm  with Operator Weighted Pruning
This is a Symbolic Regression project that is currently being developed. Symbolic regressions consists of a "general non-linear regression", in the sense that it searches for a symbolic expression to fit a dataset without the requirement to define previously the function form beforehand. This method searches the infinite space of combinations between operators, functions, features and parameters utilizing genetic programming to find an expression that best fit the input data. Applications range from physics to health care and economics (specially stock market).
