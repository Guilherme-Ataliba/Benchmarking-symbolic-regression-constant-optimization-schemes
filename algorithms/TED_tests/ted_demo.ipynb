    "## Tree Edit Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree edit distance ([Zhang and Shasha, 1989](https://doi.org/10.1137/0218082)) describes the distance between trees as the number of node deletions, node insertions, and node relabelings we need to apply to transform one tree into another. According to their definition, node deletions push all children of the deleted node up to its parent and insertions push child nodes down to be children of the newly inserted node. The following examples illustrate the edits."

    "Note that we denote trees in a node list/adjacency list format. For example, the tree $a(b, c)$ has the node list `[a, b, c]` (in depth-first-search order) and node 0 has nodes 1 and 2 as children, whereas nodes 1 and 2 have no children of their own, which results in the adjacency list `[[1, 2], [], []]`.\n",

This example also illustrates that the tree edit distance and the sequence edit distance are _not_ the same thing, because the sequence edit distance on the node list would only be $2$."
